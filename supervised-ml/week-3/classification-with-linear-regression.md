# Classification With Linear Regression

The model will produce a handful of possible output/numbers

## Motivation

**Examples of Classification Problems:**

Question | Answer "$y$"
- Is the email  spam or not? ---> yes/no
- Is the transaction fraudluent or not? ---> yes/no
- Is the tumor maligant? ---> yes/no


**Notes:**

- $y$ can only be one of ***two*** values
- "binary classification"
- class = category
- The class naming depends on the question asked, so Context is important
- The class does not mean that whether it's good or not

**Another naming conventions which are useful for classfication:**

- No  / 0 / false / negative class / absence
- Yes / 1 / true  / positive class / presence

<br/>

In the plot line, the y axis will be the class malignant?, and for the x axis will be tumor size

- 0 will represent no
- 1 will represent yes.

Linear regression can be used for classification
