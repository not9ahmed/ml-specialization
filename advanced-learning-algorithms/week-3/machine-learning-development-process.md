# Machine Learning Development Process


## Iterative Loop of ML Development

1. Choose Architecture (Model, Data, etc)

2. Train Model

3. Diagnostics (Bias, Variance, Error Analysis)
   - Make neural netowrk bigger, change $\lambda$ regularization parameter, add more data, add more features or remove features.
