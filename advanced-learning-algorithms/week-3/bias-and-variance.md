# Bias And Variance


## Diaganosing Bias and Variance


### Bias/Variance

Looking athe Bias and Variance of learning algorithms gives a good guidance on what to do next.

For simple feature it's easy to diagnoise to find the algorithm performance.

Systematic way to find the algorithm performance is by looking at the training set and cross validation set.


#### High Bias (Underfit)

$d=1$  
$J_{train}$ is high  
$J_{cv}$ is high


#### Just Right

$d=2$  
$J_{train}$ is low  
$J_{cv}$ is low


#### High Variance (Overfit)

$d=4$  
$J_{train}$ is low  
$J_{cv}$ is high
