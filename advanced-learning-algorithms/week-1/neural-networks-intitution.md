# Neural Networks Intitution


## Neurons and the Brain

Neural networks also called artifical neural networks


**Origins:**
- Algorithms that try to mimic the brain.
- Used in the 1980's and early 1990's.
- Fell out of favor in the late 1990's.
- Resurgence from around 2005.

Modern Deep learning helped in rebranding the neural networks.

**Modern Neural Networks/Deep Learning Applications are:**
- Speech Recognition imporved due to deep learning
- Computer Vision & Images due to imagenet
- Text (NLP Natural Language Processing) used in international translation.
- Other Appplication: Climate Change, product recommendation


The following diagram showcases how the neurons work:
- All human thoughts from neurons like these in brain and mind
- The neurons send electrical impluses/ or form othe connections with neurons
- Has number of inputs, which it recieves electrical impluses from other neurons.
- The neuron then carries computations, and send outputs to other neurons
- and the same happens to the recieving network

The below image shows a comparison between the biological neurons, and the simplified mathematical neurons. The two neurons take some input values, then carry out a computation then it sends the result to other neurons.

### Why Now?

Why has neural networks has taken off??

Amount of digital data has exploded

**The traditional machine learning algorithms logistic & linear regression faced some issue which are:**
- Even if they were feed more data, it was difficult to get the performance going up.
- They cannot utilize the large amount of data.
- They cannot scale with the large amount of data.


**Large Neural Networks** are better choice for very large amount of data!  
- To take advantage of the huge of amount of data for speech recognition.
So that's why Deep Learning took off
- Faster Computer Processors (GPUs) also helped in making Deep Learning trending.


The following image showcases why the neural networks are trending now, which is due to the huge amount of data, and faster CPUs.
